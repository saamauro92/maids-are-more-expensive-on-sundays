            <h2> Alicia I. Ciocca,</h2>
          <p>
            was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on the 1st of September, 1956.
            As a Teacher of English, she worked for many years at primary and
            secondary schools in her home town before founding the family-run
            company Global Studies along with one of her six sons. The main
            activity at Global Studies has been recruiting students from
            Argentina and accompanying them to do courses in Bournemouth,
            England.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of her wide experience on her group trips to Bournemouth
            schools Alicia feels this place -she loves so much- has been the
            inspiring force and hence the setting for her novel and the
            fictional characters. 
            </p>
            <p>
            At present she is an Educational Consultant at
            Global Studies
